# Developing a Telegram Game

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and deploying a game for Telegram.

## Prerequisites

1. A Telegram account
2. BotFather access on Telegram
3. A web server to host your game (can be services like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS)
4. Basic knowledge of HTML5, JavaScript, and web development

## Step 1: Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for "@BotFather"
2. Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command
3. Follow the instructions to create your bot
4. Save the API token provided by BotFather (you'll need this later)

## Step 2: Set Up the Game

1. Send `/newgame` to BotFather
2. Choose a name for your game
3. Send a photo that will be shown in the game's messages
4. Provide a short description of your game
5. Send the URL where your game will be hosted
   - The game must be hosted on HTTPS
   - The game should be mobile-friendly
   - Must work in the Telegram web view

## Step 3: Game Development Guidelines

### Technical Requirements

- Games must be built using HTML5
- Games should work well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Must support various screen sizes
- Should load quickly and be optimized for mobile data

### Integration Requirements

1. Include the Telegram Web App JS file in your game:
```html
<script src="https://telegram.org/js/games.js"></script>
```

2. Essential game events to implement:
```javascript
// Initialize the game
TelegramGameProxy.initParams();

// Report score to Telegram
TelegramGameProxy.shareScore();
```

### Best Practices

1. Keep the initial loading size small
2. Implement progressive loading if needed
3. Use responsive design principles
4. Implement sound controls (mute/unmute)
5. Save game progress when possible

## Step 4: Development Structure

Create the following files for your game:

1. `index.html` - Main game page
2. `game.js` - Game logic
3. `styles.css` - Game styling
4. `assets/` - Directory for images, sounds, etc.

## Step 5: Testing

1. Test your game thoroughly on:
   - Different mobile devices
   - Various screen sizes
   - Both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Different browsers
   - Slow internet connections

2. Use the Telegram gaming platform's test mode:
   - Add "?socketUrl=wss://tg.dev/gameee" to your game URL
   - This enables testing without actual deployment

## Step 6: Deployment

1. Host your game on a secure HTTPS server
2. Update the game URL in BotFather using `/setgame`
3. Test the deployed version in Telegram

## Step 7: Publishing and Sharing

1. Share your game using:
```
https://t.me/{your_bot_username}/{short_name_of_game}
```

2. You can also create a button in your bot that launches the game

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **HTTPS Issues**
   - Ensure your server has a valid SSL certificate
   - All resources (images, scripts) must be served over HTTPS

2. **Mobile Compatibility**
   - Use viewport meta tags
   - Test touch controls thoroughly
   - Ensure UI elements are properly sized for mobile

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Optimize assets
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Minimize initial payload size

## Next Steps

1. Choose a game concept that works well in Telegram's environment
2. Set up your development environment
3. Create a basic prototype
4. Test extensively
5. Deploy and share with users

Remember to follow Telegram's guidelines and terms of service when developing your game.
